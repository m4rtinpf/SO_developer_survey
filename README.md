# SO_developer_survey

# Introduction
## Purpose
The purpose of this notebook is to make a portfolio project to showcase some basic data science skills.

This is the second project of this kind that I make. The first one was a rehash of a tutorial project. This one was made without following a tutorial.

This notebook is also available [here](https://m4rtinpf.github.io/SO_survey.html).

## Topic
We will analyse the software market for jobs, from the point of view of the developers.

Some things we will explore are salaries, country of origin, size of companies, amount of hours worked per week, age, technologies worked with, and years of experience.
